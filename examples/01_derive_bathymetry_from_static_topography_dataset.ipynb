If applied directly this will yield more or less the same result as our original elevation, as interpolation will occur from shore to shore. Hence, we first need elevation values somewhere in the middle of the reservoir. We use the ``skeletonize_bathymetry`` method to establish this. It will create a skeleton of elevation values from the shoreline that contains elevation, to the most downstream point where the missing area stops and elevation values are available. This process can be repeated starting with the largest strahler stream order found, that bounds the missing area, then moving to lower stream orders consecutively. Elevation values are filled using the method by Messager et al. (2016).\n",
